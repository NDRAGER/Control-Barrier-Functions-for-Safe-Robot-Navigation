	Safe navigation in dynamic environments is a critical challenge in modern robotics, particularly in applications such as multi-robot warehouses where collision avoidance must be guaranteed without compromising operational efficiency. This report presents an implementation of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) as a safety filter for differential drive robots navigating in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. Our approach combines mathematical safety guarantees with a turn-first avoidance strategy that prioritizes maintaining forward momentum over stopping, enabling faster navigation through constrained spaces. We implement a priority-based coordination system for multi-robot scenarios and validate our approach through simulation studies. The results demonstrate that CBFs provide robust safety guarantees while maintaining high operational efficiency, with the system successfully avoiding collisions in various scenarios including single-robot obstacle avoidance, multi-obstacle navigation, and robot-robot interaction. The quadratic programming formulation enables real-time computation, making the approach practical for industrial applications.
